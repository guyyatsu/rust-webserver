# In-House(Personal) Rust TCP Web-Server

So I've been meaning to get into Rust seriously for a long time now, always kind of scratched the surface but never really was any good at it.  

Lately after a short hiatus I wanted to get back in the swing of things, but because I'm using a Windows computer now my Python virtual environments don't work the way I'm used to so I decided that if I'm going to have to start from the bottm anyways I may as well start from the bottom of something new.  

And here we are; reviving my website again only this time I'm going yet another layer deeper by re-writing everything in Rust.


## Housekeeping & To-Do List

- [ ] Allocate and Write pages and routes for the very top level of interaction.
- [ ] Implement argument handling for ease of scripting.
